When you see the "cannot find symbol" error in Java, 
it means the compiler doesn't recognize an identifier (variable, class, method, etc.)

1. Read the error message carefully:
The ^ points to the problematic symbol

Pro Tips:
Use an IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code) - they highlight these errors immediately

Pay attention to the exact symbol name in the error message

Remember that Java's standard classes follow strict naming conventions (PascalCase for classes, camelCase for methods)

The error always means: "I looked for this name, but I couldn't find anything with that name in the current context."
